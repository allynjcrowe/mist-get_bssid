# mist-get_bssid
 
This script is used to retrieve information for an input file of MAC addresses of mist APs from a specific site and export information on them to a CSV. The current input format expected is the export from the mist portal inventory page (again for a site).

Information currently includes: 
- Name
- Name of the map the AP is located on (if it's on a map)
- MAC
- BSSIDs for active radios 
- LLDP name and port_id of the device it's connected to

Currently uses n+1 API calls where n is the number of  in the input file
